### Bio: [Supratim Haldar](http://supratimh.github.io)
### Collection of my practice and project work in Data Science and Machine Learning. The repository is organized as follows:

* [statistics](https://github.com/SupratimH/learning-data-science/tree/master/statistics): Implementations of core concepts of statistics using Python 3.

* [machine-learning](https://github.com/SupratimH/learning-data-science/tree/master/machine-learning): My implementations of core machine learning algorithms using only Python 3 and Numpy.
  * [Anomaly Detection: An implementation (from scratch) to detect server hardware performance anomalies](https://github.com/SupratimH/learning-data-science/blob/master/machine-learning/anomaly-detection.ipynb)
  * [Movie Recommender System using Collaborative Filtering from scratch: recommend movies to user based on taste of other similar users](https://github.com/SupratimH/learning-data-science/blob/master/machine-learning/collaborative-filtering.ipynb)
  * [Movie Recommender System using Content-Based Filtering from scratch: recommend movies based on plot, cast and crew, genres and keywords](https://github.com/SupratimH/learning-data-science/blob/master/machine-learning/collaborative-filtering.ipynb)

* [ml-using-libraries](https://github.com/SupratimH/learning-data-science/tree/master/ml-using-libraries): Understanding of core machine learning algorithms using standard libraries, such as scikit-learn.

* [project-playground](https://github.com/SupratimH/learning-data-science/tree/master/project-playground): Solutions to real world use cases using data collected from public repositories.
