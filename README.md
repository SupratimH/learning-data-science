# Learning-Data-Science

### Collection of my practice and project work in Data Science and Machine Learning. The repository is organized as follows:

* [statistics](https://github.com/SupratimH/learning-data-science/tree/master/statistics): Implementations of core concepts of statistics using Python 3.
* [machine-learning](https://github.com/SupratimH/learning-data-science/tree/master/machine-learning): My implementations of core machine learning algorithms using only Python 3 and Numpy.
* [ml-using-libraries](https://github.com/SupratimH/learning-data-science/tree/master/ml-using-libraries): Understanding of core machine learning algorithms using standard libraries, such as scikit-learn.
* [project-playground](https://github.com/SupratimH/learning-data-science/tree/master/project-playground): Solutions to real world use cases using data collected from public repositories.
